Notes:

  (Signs)
  This is something the founders themselves personally want
  This only recently became possible
  Similar companies exist
  
  (X Filters)
  Hard to get started
  Boring space
  Seems too ambitious
  Too many competitors
  
  (Recipe)
  You start with what your team is especially good at
  Think of things you wish someone else would build for you 
  Answer what would you be excited to work on for 10 years even if it fails
  Look for things that changed in the world recently - new tech/platform/regulation
  Find companies that have been successfully, and look for new variants of them
  Crowdsource problems that need solving for other people
  Look for industries that seem broken

> Comment: The idea suggests people will stop relying on portfolio managers in the future. There are two things that can make this to happen. First, financial data that is pertinent will be required by law to be made readily available. Second, robo advisors or machine learning driven stock portfolio management systems will become smarter and outperform human portfolio managers. Individuals will want to take active participation in stock investing with the same tools as hedge funds. Examples of these tools include machine learning algorithms that identify short-term trends and quantum annealing to optimize stock portfolio rebalancing. The weakness of this idea is that this is not an acute problem and among different stock advisors, this may work but it may not even be the best performing one.
