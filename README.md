> The new paradigm suggests that people will stop relying on portfolio managers in the future. There are two things that can help this to happen. First, financial data that is pertinent will be required by law to be made readily available. Second, robo advisors or machine learning driven stock portfolio management systems will become smarter and outperform human portfolio managers. Individuals will want to take active participation in stock investing with the same tools as hedge funds. Examples of these tools include machine learning algorithms that identify short-term trends and quantum annealing to optimize stock portfolio rebalancing.
